## Template 1: Expat / Relocation Blogs

**Subject line options** (pick one):
- Free salary tool for your readers (no catch)
- Quick idea for [Blog Name] — free embeddable tool
- Would your readers use this? (salary converter widget)

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I've been reading [Blog Name] — your post on [specific recent article title] was really useful, especially the section about [specific detail].

I built a free salary comparison tool at salary-converter.com that your readers might find helpful when evaluating relocation decisions. It covers 113 cities and 2,400+ neighborhoods worldwide, with real tax breakdowns, cost-of-living adjustments, and purchasing power calculations.

There's a free embeddable widget you can drop into any page — it's a single iframe, about 40 KB, and works on mobile. No API keys, no signup, no cost. It just works.

Here's a live demo: https://salary-converter.com/widget/

Embed code is literally one line:
```
<iframe src="https://salary-converter.com/embed.html" width="100%" height="800" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

Happy to customize the size or anything else if it'd be a better fit for your layout. Totally understand if it's not the right fit — no worries either way.

Best,
Jason

## Template 2: HR / Career Sites

**Subject line options:**
- Free salary tool for [Company/Site Name]'s career resources
- Salary comparison widget — free for your team/readers

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Site Name] has resources around [compensation/relocation/hiring internationally] — thought this might be a useful addition.

I built a free salary converter that adjusts for cost of living, taxes, and purchasing power across 113 cities. It's designed for people evaluating job offers in different locations or companies benchmarking international compensation.

There's a free embeddable widget (single iframe, no dependencies, mobile-responsive) that you can add to any career resources page:

https://salary-converter.com/widget/

No cost, no login, no tracking of your users. Data updates automatically from Numbeo, OECD, and ECB sources.

Would this be useful for your audience? Happy to chat if you have questions.

Best,

## Template 3: Digital Nomad Communities / Remote Work Blogs

**Subject line options:**
- Built a free tool your nomad readers would actually use
- Salary converter for remote workers — free widget
- This might help your readers decide where to move next

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Love what you're building at [Blog/Community Name]. Your [specific post/resource] on [topic] is one of the better ones out there.

I made a free salary comparison tool that I think remote workers and digital nomads would actually use — it goes beyond basic COL calculators by including neighborhood-level adjustments (2,400+ neighborhoods), tax breakdowns, and family vs. single modes.

So instead of just "Bangkok is cheaper than London," it shows exactly what a $80K USD salary is worth in Chiang Mai's Nimman area vs. Lisbon's Alfama — down to take-home pay after taxes.

There's a free widget you can embed on any page with one line of code:

https://salary-converter.com/widget/

No signup, no cost, no tracking. Data auto-updates from Numbeo, OECD, and ECB.

Would your readers find this useful? Totally fine if it's not a fit.

Cheers,
Jason

Hi [Name],

Just bumping this in case it got buried — I know inboxes are rough.

Quick version: I built a free embeddable salary converter (113 cities, 2,400+ neighborhoods, real tax data). One-line iframe embed, no cost or signup.

No pressure at all — just thought it might add value for your readers.

Best,

## Template 5: Reddit / Forum Posts (not an email — post directly)

**For r/expat, r/digitalnomad, r/IWantOut, r/personalfinance:**

**Title:** I built a free salary converter that adjusts for cost of living, taxes, and neighborhoods (113 cities, 2,400+ neighborhoods)

**Body:**

I kept seeing the same question on this sub — "what salary do I need in [city] to match my current lifestyle?" — and existing tools only give you a rough COL index without accounting for taxes, neighborhoods, or purchasing power.

So I built one that does: https://salary-converter.com

It covers 113 cities and 2,400+ neighborhoods worldwide. You pick your current city + salary, pick a target city, and it gives you the true equivalent — adjusted for cost of living, income tax, social contributions, and even neighborhood-level price differences.

Example: $75,000 in Houston ≠ the same lifestyle as $75,000 in London. The tool shows you'd actually need ~$112,000 in London, and breaks down exactly why (rent, taxes, groceries, etc.).

Features:
- Single & family modes (dual income, childcare costs)
- Neighborhood-level adjustments (e.g., Manhattan vs. Brooklyn, Zone 1 vs. Zone 3 London)
- Full tax breakdowns
- Job-title salary ranges adjusted for each city

It's completely free, no login required. Data from Numbeo, OECD, and ECB.

Happy to answer questions or take feedback — still actively improving it.
